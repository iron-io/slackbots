This repo goes along with this blog post on [Serverless Slack Bots](http://blog.iron.io/2015/03/super-easy-serverless-slack-bots.html)

I started building more and more bots on my a personal repository so you're better off looking at 
that one. Consider this one deprecated. 

New Repo: https://github.com/treeder/slackbots
